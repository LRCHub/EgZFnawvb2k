From the Album:
* Face it

It don't look like a happy home
For the monkey in the corner
Behind the bars inside the cage
The sadness makes me shiver
Freedom don't last forever
It's no way never near good taste
And puts my good sense to the test
Makes me wonder who's the beast
In the eyes of the audience
Freedom don't last forever
And the way love burns
Twists and turns and tears us all apart
Let me tell you my old friend
It can also break your heart!
Can't take no more
Lock the door
Leave me with my self pity
Leave me alone
With my lazy bones
And a banana on the branch of my tree
(With a dream and a memory)
Loneliness is a ghost
Trapped in a room of silence
Inside my head I hear the roar
The roar of a crazy lion
Freedom don't last forever
